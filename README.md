## Features

- Calculate cooking yield percentage
- Calculate loss percentage
- Supports grams and ounces
- Searchable food selection
- Stores entries locally (localStorage)
- Fully client-side (no backend required)

## How It Works

1. Select a food.
2. Enter raw weight.
3. Enter cooked weight.
4. View yield %, loss %, and raw per 100g cooked.

## Why This Exists

Cooking changes food weight due to water evaporation and fat rendering. PrepYield helps remove guesswork for meal prep, portion control, and consistency.
